# Dswebdocs Workbench

Dswebdocs Workbench builds a development environment. Canonical Multipass creates a virtual machine as a local development environment that mimics the production VPS(Virtual Private Server). Docker containers isolate running services inside VM/VPS. Ansible automates installation/management tasks. After development we can publish to a VPS with Ansible, and Docker.

Developed on Ubuntu 24.04, so these instructions will work on  Ubuntu 24.04. Not tested on other systems at the moment. 


May not be suitable for production use.

Current status: Development is stopped. https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify project offers a better solution then Dswebdocs Workbench, so this project stays as a public archive.
